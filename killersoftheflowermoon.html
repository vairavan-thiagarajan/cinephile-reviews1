        Killers of the Flower Moon is a 2023 American epic Western crime drama film directed and produced by Martin Scorsese, who co-wrote the script with Eric Roth based on the 2017 non-fiction book by David Grann. Set in 1920s Oklahoma, it focuses on a series of murders of Osage members and relations in the Osage Nation after oil was discovered on tribal land. The tribal members had retained mineral rights on their reservation, but a corrupt local political boss sought to steal the tribal members' wealth.

    <p class="review">
        
Killers of the Flower Moon, a historical crime drama based on the Osage Indian murders during 1920-1930s, made in the perspective of the accused(s), is a perfectly directed piece of art, illustrating the magic of the great Martin Scorsese again like all his projects. You exactly get what you expect before watching one of his movies, & everytime he delivers it, unbelievably consistent, evidently depicting his might. 
His both most favorites, the legendary duo Robert De Niro & Leonardo DiCaprio, being Scorsese's old & regular accomplices, just nailed their characters again like always, no need of mentioning. Special mention goes to Lily Gladstone, who did a magnificent performance, a very difficult character to portray, but Gladstone just made it look like easy. I suppose this will easily be one of the finest performances of this year by a female actor, if not the finest. Rest all the actors were on point with their characters, did their job satisfactorily. 
Overall, after waiting for over a year, the movie was totally satisfying for me personally, with all the boxes ticked. This is a must-watch for all the cinema lovers across the globe
