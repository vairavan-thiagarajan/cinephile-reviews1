        The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American epic biographical black comedy crime film co-produced and directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, based on Jordan Belfort's 2007 memoir of the same name. It recounts Belfort's career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm, Stratton Oakmont, engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street, leading to his downfall. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend, Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his second wife, Naomi Lapaglia, Matthew McConaughey as his mentor and former boss Mark Hanna, and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham. It is DiCaprio's fifth collaboration with Martin Scorsese.

        REVIEW
    </h3>
    <p class="review">
        At first I would like to say that the freakiness of the movie makes me to love this and I would like to give this movie 8.5 out of 10 stars.
This movie is not a generic biopic of prominent, respectable person but is based on a true story on a stockbroker named Jordan Belfort. It is a rollercoaster ride which takes Jordan from nobody to a rich man. This movie was quite inspiring and I absolutely enjoyed Belfort’s character. He is clever, bold, risk-taking, has a chill attitude, and has effective leadership skills which made a synergistic effect. The movie also showed that some incidents or people in our life might show us a complete new different direction which may be positive or negative like in the movie Mathew guided Belfort how to earn more money, how to deal with the customers. This leaded a significant change in Belfort’s personality.
Margor Robbie, Jonah hill, Mathew played their parts nicely. I just loved watching 3 hours of intensity.
